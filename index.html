<h4>What is COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM?</h4>
Combinatorial optimization is the process of searching for maxima (or minima) of an objective function F whose domain is a discrete but large configuration space (as opposed to an N-dimensional continuous space).<br>
Some  simple  examples  of  typical  combinatorial  optimization problems are:
<ol>
<li> Traveling Salesman Problem</li>
<li>Bin-Packing</li>
<li>Subset Sum Problem</li>
<li>Knapsack Problem</li>
<li>Hamiltonian path problem</li>
</ol>
In this project we will be working on the Subset Sum Problem

<h4> What is <b>SUBSET SUM PROBLEM </b>?</h4>
The <b>Subset Sum Problem</b> belongs to category of decision problems.  The problem states that given a set (or multiset) of integers, is it possible to construct a non-empty subset whose sum is equal to zero?
 
<p>For example, given the set { − 40 , − 2 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 }  , the answer is "yes" because the subset { − 2 , 2 } sums to zero.
The <b>Subset Sum Problem</b> belongs to complexity class of NP-complete, meaning it is easier to evaluate whether the final result obtained is correct or not. Also, this checking can be done in polynomial time. The problem itself takes non-deterministic polynomial time to find the solution. The <b>subset sum problem</b> is used in the field of complexity theory and cryptography.
<p>In computational complexity theory, a problem is NP-complete when it can be solved by a restricted class of brute force search algorithms and it can be used to simulate any other problem with a similar algorithm. More precisely, each input to the problem should be associated with a set of solutions of polynomial length, whose validity can be tested quickly (in polynomial time), such that the output for any input is "yes" if the solution set is non-empty and "no" if it is empty (<i>source : <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness'> wikipedia</a></i>).

The <b>Subset Sum Problem</b> can be thought of as a modification to <b>knapsack problem</b> where the limit of the bag is infinite and the assumption that the weight of the elements can ne negative.

<h4>OTHER VARIATIONS OF THE PROBLEM</h4>
<ol>
<li><b>Subset Sum Problem</b> where the sum is equal to some constant. This variation is extenion of the question such that the sum instead of 0 can be any other integer <i>k</i> <br>Example - Suppose the parent set is {− 2 , 0 , 1 , 3}. and we are find subset such that sum equals 2. The answer is "yes" the subset {− 2 , 1 ,  3}  gives the sum=<i>2</i>.</li><br>
<li><b>Subset Sum Problem</b> where it is posibble to subdivide this set into two strict subsets such that the sum of elements of one set is equal to another set. 
<br>Example - Suppose the parent set is {− 2 , 0 , 1 , 3}. The answer is "yes" the subsets are {− 2 ,  3} and {0 , 1 } where the sum of elements is <i>1</i></li>.
</ol>
For simplicity we will just be working with the simple variation where the subset sum has to be equal to <i>0</i>.

<h4> PROJECT PROPOSAL AND APPROACH </h4>

For our project we will try to implement the <b>Subset Sum Problem</b> problem using Qunatum Computers. We will try to run it in Qiskit . So suppose we have 'x' elements in our set and we are supposed to find the subset with 'm' elements such that <i>m<=x</i> and the sum of 'm' elements =0. So to work with Quantum Circuits we wll have 'x' Qubits as our input to the circuit and then the output will be in terms of quibit value {0,1}. If the i<sup>th </sup>line's output is '0' it signifies that the i<sup>th  </sup> element is not included in our answer. Similarly, If the i<sup>th  </sup>line's output is '1' it signifies that the i<sup>th  </sup> element is included in our answer.  
<p>
In Classical Computing world, the problem of Subset Sum
Problem  has  complexity  of  O(2<sup>n</sup>
).  The  objective  of  our  approach is to achieve Quantum Supremacy. Even if we are not
able to show that the algorithm produces Quantum Supremacy
it should at least be Quantum advantageous.In other words it is
sufficient enough for us to show that the complexity achieved
from the Quantum Computing should be less than O(2<sup>n</sup>
). 
<h4>CHALLENGES</h4>
<ol>
<li>Figure out a way to construct circuit and determine what
gates to use.</li>
<li>The  Qiskit  right  now  supports  till  30  Qubits.  So  the
maximum element number of elements in our array for
our input should be way less than 30.</li>
<li>One  of  the  biggest  problem  would  be  to  optimize  the
use  of  ancilla  bits  so  that  we  can  use  more  and  more
qubits for the input.</li>
<li>Determine  whether  the  problem  falls  under  Quantum
supremacy class or quantum advantage class.</li>
